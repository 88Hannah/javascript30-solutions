<!-- My imporvements
	- changed backgrounds and colours
	- added a circle to cover where the hands all meet
	- stopped the transition on all hands when they move to zero seconds
	- made the hour hand move between the hour markers as the hour progresses
	- made the second hand thinner and the hour hand shorter
	- for the hour hand I then had to take into account the additional translation needed to centre it
